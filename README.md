# üéµ Spotify Replacer

**Spotify Replacer** is a web application that allows you to download the songs from a Spotify playlist quickly, efficiently, and easily ‚Äî all for free.


## üèóÔ∏è Deployment

The repository can be cloned and run locally using the following steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mateo-ledovith/spotify-replacer.git
cd spotify-replacer

bash run_docker.sh
```

Then, access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

**Note:** To run this application, you must have **Docker** installed on your system. Please ensure that Docker is properly installed before proceeding with the deployment steps.


## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Login:**  
   - The user visits the web app and authenticates via **OAuth 2.0** using their Spotify account.
   
2. **Playlist Selection:**  
   - The application sends a request to the **Spotify API** to retrieve all of the user's playlists.  
   - The playlists are displayed on screen, and the user selects the one they wish to download.

3. **Track Search:**  
   - The list of songs and corresponding artists from the selected playlist is retrieved.  
   - The third-party library **Youtube Search Python** is used to search for a corresponding YouTube link for each song.

4. **Download and Conversion:**  
   - The audio is downloaded using **yt_dlp**.  
   - The downloaded file is converted to the appropriate format with **FFmpeg**.

5. **Compression and Delivery:**  
   - Once all songs have been downloaded, they are packaged into a **ZIP file**.  
   - The user can then download the ZIP file containing all the songs.  
   - Temporary files are automatically removed from the server.
